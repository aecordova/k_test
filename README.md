## Description of the project

This is a sample application to demonstrate technical proficiency on Rails. Some daycare center needs to keep track of the activities performed by babies. So, they plan to request the development of a web app that could enable the education assitants to record such ativities.

Requirements:

Part 1: Create API endpoints to create activity log records according to the provided ERD.

| API EndPoints:  |   |
|---|---|
| GET api/activities  | List of activities  |
| GET api/babies  | List of babies  |
| GET api/babies/:id/activity_logs  | List of aassigned activities  for each baby |
| POST api/activity_logs  | Start/Create a new Activity record  |
| PUT api/activity_logs/:id  | Modify/End an activity, allowing for comment addition  |
| Restrictions: |  |
| Responses should be in JSON. Activities cant be ended prior to the time they have been started |
| Activities cant be ended prior to the time they have been started |
| DatesTime fields should be handled in UTC and iso8601 format |
| Dates should be returned in  YYYY-MM-DD format |
| Endpoins should use the corresponding CRUD action according to what they perform |
| Endpoins should respond with the corresponding HTTP status |
| They should consider errors for entering the wrong dates with descriptive error messages |

Part 2: Create a web app to review the log of activities of the babies in the daycare. 

| Web App:  |   |
|---|---|
| Path:  |  /activity_logs  |
| Order of logs:  | Newest to oldest descending  |
| Duration:  | Show duration in minutes, once the activity has finished |
| Filters:  | For filtering options, the user can choose the either/both baby's and/or the assitant's names and/ot the activity status   |
| Restrictions: |  |
| Login pages and access levels are not required |
| DateTimes should be shown in local time |
| Use bootstrap with default formatting, It doesnt require an complex design |

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Running the code

#### Live Version:

You can find a live running version of this app on the following link: [Activity Logs](https://kinedu-test.herokuapp.com//)

#### Instructions for running on local environment:

1. Clone the repo

2. Navigate to the root directory

***  Important: *** <br> 
This app uses Maria DB, you should have it installed on your computer for it to work correctly. Otherwhise, open the Gemfile and change the mysql2 gem for any other db gem  ***
